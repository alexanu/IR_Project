research into materials conduct electricity with minimal resistance could lead further gains tokyo booming stock market brokers said said share prices companies likely benefit from called superconductors rose sharply last week after publication articles about research economic daily nihon keizai shimbun companies were ferrous metal electrical and mining sectors but industry analysts said development problems remain and commercial application still some years away area clearly has significant applications but won commercially viable for few years said thomas murtha technology analyst with james capel and industry analysts said superconductors could bring sharp cuts electricity costs present problems can overcome nikko securities ltd analyst shinichi nakayama said superconductors could have applications computer circuitry electricity generation and storage and scientific research superconductors made blend metals fused heat firing process similar used ceramics nakayama said kawasaki steel corp predicted house study 1990 worldwide market would worth 150 billion yen for superconductors used computers billion for those used electricity generators and 150 billion for those used electricity storage study said 1995 would trains capable 500 hour hovering magnetic field and powered mainly superconductors hundred billion yen worth superconducting material would needed for such train kawasaki study also said superconductors would used nuclear fusion physics but not until year 2000 industry analysts said superconductors have commercial applications present laboratory tests conductor must cooled expensive liquid helium hydrogen before minimum electrical resistance achieved liquid nitrogen which much less expensive has recently also been used successfully said despite this investors tokyo stock market have boosted shares firms related superconducting materials from close trading march until yesterday close mitsubishi mining and cement ltd share price rose 140 yen 485 yen same period mitsubishi metal corp rose 745 yen sumitomo metal mining ltd rose 200 1440 yen and kawasaki steel rose 260 furukawa electric ltd shares jumped 104 yen 689 yen and fuji electric ltd rose 141 619 brokers said shares suppliers scientific instruments needed conduct superconductor research also rose industry analysts said most favoured superconductor made from blend yttrium barium and copper currently undergoing laboratory tests under scheme coordinated ministry international trade and industry miti reuter
