officials toshiba told reporters have developed kind wire which can conduct electricity with resistance and therefore loss power although firms have developed such superconductive materials toshiba scientists said discovery first allows material formed into pliable wire developing superconducting material works room temperature with resistance object frenetic worldwide scientific race main applications would super powerful magnets small computers immense power and speed electric transmission lines which negligible power and electric generators which consume power toshiba said will probably five years before can incorporate superconductors marketable machines but problems still have surmounted present superconductors including toshiba cooled very low temperatures before can pass electricity with resistance this requires costly liguid gas coolants superconductors developed date transmit only small currents and cannot conduct alternating current only direct current government scientists said toshiba which spent 190 billion yen research and development year ended march 1986 counts itself among leading superconductor research companies japan manager toshiba public relations yuji wakayama said wires company uses blend yttrium barium and copper oxide and can conduct with resistance minus 179 degrees centigrade reuter
