international business machines corp said scientists its zurich research laboratory have taken step developing method testing computer chips with laser technique important ibm said because could lead development tools can determine quality microscopic sized computer chips without damaging them ibm said chip makers will such advanced testing methods aid them developing next generation semiconductors these chips will smaller today chips but will able store vastly greater amounts information ibm said its technique uses laser light for contactless measuring electrical signals metal lines similar kind found computer chip circuitry said using commercially available lasers method should permit measurements circuits with width micrometer less micrometer about times smaller thickness sheet paper reuter
