international business machines corp said demonstrated experimental computer chip called opto electronic receiver transforms light into electrical signals translate into computer language ibm said chip two times faster any similar chip reported and can read encyclopedia volumes second chip made gallium arsenide which moves electrical signals faster silicon used most computer circuits ibm also said since gallium arsenide more efficient turning light signals into electrical signals seems ideal material for light based computer communications expected widely used future chip speed also enhanced through elimination wiring placing functionally dissimilar photodetector and transistor circuitry close together bringing these elements closer together also isolates receiver from electronic circuits and reduces noise and distortion said reuter
