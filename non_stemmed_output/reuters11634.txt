semiconductor manufacturers struggling stem river red ink increasingly looking customized designs rather mass market chips for future profits market for customized chips semiconductors designed for very specific application product expected expand pct this year compared with only about six pct for entire integrated circuit industry market researcher dataquest inc estimates sales customized chips totaled about billion dlrs worldwide last year about pct total chip market 1990 however customized chips expected represent billion billion dlr market about pct total chip sales more important for vendors because not standard design customized chips represent sellers market and prices and profit margins can set accordingly high volume memory chips have perfect commodity market robert brodersen professor electrical engineering university california berkeley told industry forum product interchangeable between manufacturer and another and customers base buying decisions almost entirely price brodersen said predicted next few years only handful world largest chip manufacturers most them japanese will produce memory chips standard electronic component found everything from digital watches computers rest industry just won involved last week international solid circuits conference chip industry annual forum for new developments seemed support brodersen prediction 116 papers presented conference some pct had japanese authors first time have outnumberd united states most japanese chip designs were memory category including nippon telephone and telegraph attention grabbing mln bit dynamic random access memory dram chip times more powerful anything now available most advanced memory chip described company was international business machine corp four mln bit chip and ibm only manufactures chips for its own internal not for open market problem with memory chips all based same well known design standards easy copy and inexpensive manufacture because such large japanese conglomerates sony corp nec corp matushita and mitsui have own enormous consumer and electronics product lines also have guaranteeed internal market for chips can produce huge amounts very low cost per unit customized chips however designed for specific customer manufactured small quantities and expensive relative standard chips computer markets increasingly looking customized chips because difficult copy thus making final product harder clone well intel corp leading manufacturer microprocessors form brains most computers alerted industry its intention switch customized chips last fall company which just reported loss for 1986 said will spend mln dlrs over next three years turn itself into leading manufacturer custom and semi custom chips intel joins some 275 companies already competing for piece customized chip business but has advantage others not ibm which owns pct stake intel has agreed share designs for many 000 chips makes for its own intel will customize those designs and sell them others will also ibm proprietary computer system for designing chips considered experts most advanced world intel success still not guaranteed however industry analysts noted far different design mass market item customized chip requires close working relationship with customer intel spent five years and 100 mln dlrs developing its newest 30386 microprocessor much faster turnarouond time and much lower development costs will required for customized chips firm succeed reuter
