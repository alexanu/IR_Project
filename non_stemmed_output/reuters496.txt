supercomputer industry getting crowded handful startup companies and some huge japanese manufacturers compete for right apply label world fastest machine products currently only about 250 supercomputers installed around world but many believe situation about change dramatically these highly specialized and extremely expensive machines move out research laboratories most them found today and into commerical applications commercial supercomputing holds most promise for this young industry handful vendors said gary smaby supercomputer analyst for piper jaffray and hopwood these commercial applications said could propel annual sales supercomputers from 850 mln dlrs 1986 billion 1990 for years two companies cray research inc and control data corp were virtually only options for customers seeking buy supercomputers but last three years number new companies have announced supercomputers using some innovative technologies and industry finally expanded enough hold its first world supercomputer exhibition santa clara last month also last month two small companies eta systems inc subsidiary control data and thinking machines corp both laid claim having world fastest computer and joint venture honeywell inc and japan nec corp honeywell nec supercomputers inc announced its entrance into market all three aiming industry leader cray research inc which holds more pct market this week cray plans joint announcement with digital equipment corp already world largest minicomputer maker some products will work both companies computers expanding market opportunities for both supers and minis even further supercomputers were initially designed only for most complex applications such predicting worldwide weather patterns fusion energy research military defense and weapons design built for speed not for standard business functions such payroll processing fastest supercomputers can perform more billion calculations per second greater combined power 100 000 personal computers also carry stratospheric price tags between mln mln dlrs each which why cray revenues could reach 600 mln dlrs last year even only shipped new and used supercomputers level would spell starvation for any standard computer company but speakers supercomputer exhibition emphasized host new applications should increase total industry shipments 150 systems year end decade most commercial customers supercomputers now machines simulate physical process such flow air over aircraft wing design and testing work but financial institutions particularly wall street brokerage houses considered next major buyers supercomputers try recognize changes stock trading patterns faster any competitors two firms goldman sachs and and morgan stanley and now using superminicomputers hybrid machines faster minicomputer but cheaper super create financial models stock and bond markets analysts said only matter time before actual supercomputers found wall street reason for shift commercial applications supercomputers coming down price new technologies greater speed lower costs cray and control data behemoths both eta and thinking machines systems technology called parallel processing which number internal processors work together solve problem with such systems problem broken and different segments assigned different processors contrast standard computers solve problem instruction time sequentially eta system eta will eventually many parallel processors capable processing billion operations per second however first eta installed florida university has only two processors later expanded four eta president lloyd thorndyke said eta represents drastic change architecture from parent company control data cyber system priced from mln mln dlrs eta contains about 240 chips each its processing units built onto board about size standard newspaper section each these boards contains equivalent miles embedded wiring took eta about years develop its supercomputer but thorndyke said expects much faster development time frames futre from both eta and its competitors leapfrog business and just took last leap said thinking machines also claims have world fastest computer and some ways this true its connection machine model can process billion instructions per second but very specialized architecture only meant for certain very specific applications mln five mln dlr connection machine uses technology called massive parallism contains 000 processors crammed into five foot cube processors all work problem once breaking down into minute bits ideal tool for applications with many unpredicatble variables according brian boyle analyst for novon research group more unpredictable things more thinking machine will appropriate said reuter
