gte corp scientists said have discoverd much simpler method for producing transistors creating entirely new electronic material new method said consists simultaneously growing metal connections and silicon crystals together form three dimensional device with connections penetrating entire device conventional transistors require many steps and have connections only surface gte laboratories created entirely new electronic material and device form which may open spectrum uses cannot even imagined this time said david decker vice president and director research for gte laboratories although still early research obviously excited have found significantly simpler and believe cheaper way produce electronic device said researchers gte created new transistor combining and heating silicon and conductive metal tantalum disilicide two grow together resulting device has microscopic metal rods extending througout chips creating three dimensional transistor should superior standard devics high power applications scientists said said because connections extend vertically througout new device has much greater volume active material conventional surface mounted connections decker said scientists still early stages research device but prototypes new device compare favorably with conventionaly made transistors and promise superior performance said prototype device also proved particularly efficient detecting light which could open new possibilities solar energy conversion development electronic cameras and greater efficiency optical communication systems reuter
